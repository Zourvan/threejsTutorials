In this repository, a collection of sample programs created with the **Three.js** library will be included. Additionally, explanations for each sample will be provided. The following topics will be covered:

- **Camera-FOV**: Examination and analysis of the FOV (Field of View) parameter in perspective cameras.
- **Camera-Near**: Analysis of the influence of the Near parameter (the near clipping distance) in perspective cameras.
